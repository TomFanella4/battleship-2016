Feel free to clone, then run two instances of Battleship.java and [watch them play](http://battleship.purduehackers.com/game).

### Attack Algorithm

The attack or "make move" algorithm is based on a statistical analysis approach. 
The idea is to create a probability distribution of the board after each move and 
attack on the cell with the highest probability.
